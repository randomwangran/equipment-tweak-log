** <2020-04-24 Fri> frontal rim brake
   I realize that the function of the rear screw (behind the fork) is
   to change the margin between the brakes and the rim.
* fit exploration
** saddle
*** <2020-04-24 Fri> angle adjustment
    Lower the front by roughly 1 or 2 deg. I feel more pressure more
    the my hand. But, I feel that the hip need to level up a little
    bit to stretch the legs.
* tips
** protection of the blue
*** <2020-04-24 Fri> taping with horizontal line
    without feeling any pain.
* Issues to solve
** TODO frontal brake need to be changed
   <2020-04-24 Fri> As I adjust the brake, I found the right side
   almost vanished.
** TODO frontal d√©railleur need to be installed
   - buy a shifter
** TODO chain need to be cut
   - study the "right" way
** TODO front rim need to be tweak
   <2020-04-24 Fri> As I adjust the brake, I found there's too much
   right/left movement.
